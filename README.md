## About The Project: FPGA MIDI Controller

## Methods
* *Data Collection*: The project’s method of data collection was through the use of an anonymous survey, created on Google Forms. The survey asked for the following demographic information: class year, race, sex, ethnicity, LGBTQIA+ identification, FGLI identification, major identification, Greek affiliation, and varsity athletic status. The race and major identification categories allowed respondents to choose multiple categories, while the rest required students to choose either yes/no or a single category. Furthermore, the survey asked the two core questions underlying our analyses: whether respondents used stimulants that were not prescribed to them in the past 6 months, and whether respondents believed the non-prescription use of stimulants as "study drugs" is popular on campus. Both of these questions were binary, yes/no questions, which follows the method of the survey conducted by FiveThirtyEight. Finally, the survey had an optional open-ended asking for student input for the Student Wellness center or campus leadership, in support of the project’s vision of providing actionable insight for key stakeholders in student wellbeing.
