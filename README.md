## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Project Overview 
* This project contains the source code which allows for a fully-functional, polyphonic MIDI keyboard connected to an FPGA with an audio output. 
* The PDF appendices contains block diagrams of the logic and state diagrams which served as the logical basis for the VHDL written. 
* The PDF report contains an overview of the project, advice for those seeking to embark on building something similar, and reflections
* This project was implemented on a Basys3 FPGA in Xilinx Vivado 2018

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [VHDL](https://nextjs.org/) - The VHSIC Hardware Description Language is a hardware description language that can model the behavior and structure of digital systems at multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from the system level down to that of logic gates, for design entry, documentation, and verification purposes
* [Xilinx Vivado](https://reactjs.org/) - Vivado Design Suite is a software suite produced by Xilinx for synthesis and analysis of HDL design
